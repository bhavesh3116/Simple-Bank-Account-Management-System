# Simple-Bank-Account-Management-System
This Python program implements a basic bank account management system using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. 
<br>
It allows users to perform operations such as adding balance, withdrawing funds, viewing balance, and displaying account information. 
<br>
The program utilizes a Account class with methods for managing private attributes (__account_number and __balance) and performing transactions safely. 
<br>
It provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with their bank account efficiently. 
<br>
This project serves as a foundational example for beginners learning OOP concepts in Python and can be used as a starting point for more complex banking applications.
